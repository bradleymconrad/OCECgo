OCECgo: A MATLAB Tool for the Sunset Model 4 Instrument
########################################################

*OCECgo* is a MATLAB-based software tool for the quantification of uncertainties in the calibration and data analysis of the Sunset Laboratory Model 4 semi-continuous thermal-optical organic/elemental carbon analyzer.

.. features-start

The accompanying submission to the `Journal of Visualized Experiments <http://www.jove.com>`_ includes the step-by-step procedure for using *OCECgo* to acquire calibration data, analyze measured data, and compute uncertainties. The *OCECgo* software includes the following features:

  * Monte Carlo-based analysis of instrument calibration and associated uncertainties:

    - Consideration of uncertainty in the carbon concentration of the external sucrose standard

    - Consideration of uncertainty in the application of sucrose via pipette during calibration

  * Monte Carlo-based analysis of uncertainty in the analysis of OCEC data:

    - Propagation of uncertainty due to calibration and split point estimation

    - Simple and rapid assessment of dominant sources of uncertainty
